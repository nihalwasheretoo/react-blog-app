## Auth Kit (Firebase)

This app uses an auth kit for authentication which comes up with multiple authentication options all under one hood. Check out the repo here : https://github.com/nihal9ns/firebase-auth-kit

Note: This app uses the route http://localhost:3000/auth as the callback URl, you will have to specify the same when configuring an Auth0 app on the Auth0 dashboard. Also, make sure you add your client ID when setting the app up for yourself. (Don't use my credentials :p)
